# Auto Tinder Swiping Bot

An Auto Tinder Swiping Bot swipes right on [Tinder](https://tinder.com) instead of you.


# Installing
Download the [Python 3](https://python.org) installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

* Run the following in the terminal to install the modules to run your program without excussions.
```
pip install selenium
```

Also to use this bot, you should download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) web browser and [Chrome Web Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) here.

# How to Use?

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 main.py
```

* Note! For the code to work you need to replace all the placeholders with your own details. e.g. ```CHROME_DRIVER_PATH```, ```FB_EMAIL```,```FB_PASSWORD```,.

Follow these instructions below.

1. If you don't already have an account on [Tinder](https://tinder.com), set one up now. Make sure you can sign in to your account using Facebook or Google.

2. Make sure you've already manually signed-in and verified your phone number with Tinder as we can't automate the phone number verification. You only have to do this once.

3. The Facebook login page opens in a new window. In order for our selenium code to work on the new window, we have to switch to the window in front.

4. If everything is okay, you should see the pop-up window disappear and you're back on the Tinder page. e.g.

**NOTE: On the free tier, Tinder only allows 100 "Likes" per day.**
